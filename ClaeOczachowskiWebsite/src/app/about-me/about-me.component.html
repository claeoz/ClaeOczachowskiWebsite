                    During my time in the <a href="https://www.sca.org/">SCA</a> (Society of Creative Anachronism) a non profit, I served the office

                    of my progress in these regards. I was awarded a lordship (a prestigious award) for my service during this time.

                    we would get over a 1000 emails a week to sift through, often having to read through tragic events.
