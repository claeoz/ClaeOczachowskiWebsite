            the following is an example of my first work and personal pet project. the game takes place in the distant future in
            which planets are decimated for a simple resource, Seraph a mineral with no useful application but rare driving its 
            value to such heights. You'll pilot a space ship from the various 6 companies and manage resources as you fight others
            to achieve your goals and ultimately ask the question. was it worth it?

        <h3>
            Flidais
        </h3>
        <p>
            Flidais is a WPF program designed to make it easier to sift through a large data store. The
            program utilizes recursion to copy, move, delete, or compress files and folders. It filters through
            files by a chosen file extension. Its name is derived after the Celtic god of hunting.
